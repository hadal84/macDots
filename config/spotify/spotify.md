1) Install spicetify via homebrew. If you don’t use home-brew, use its official site: “spicetify.app”

1,5) If it spits out any instructions related to PATH or something, make sure to follow them.

2) When it is installed, run “spicetify backup” and then, “spicetify apply”. 

3) Go to, “https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started” this site and install the marketplace using the provided script.

3,5) If you get stuck on any of these steps, read the docs linked above, they are pretty good.

4) Now we will install some extensions/themes.
	- You will see a new icon appear in your spicetify sidebar. Click on it.
	- Install the “Beautiful Lyrics” Extension.
	- Install the “Burnt Sienna” Theme.
	- Also install “Adblock” if you don’t have premium, I don’t so this comes in pretty handy.


5) We will now apply some custom CSS. Go to the marketplace tab, and click on the paintbrush icon. Paste this in, and click “SAVE”:

[Base]
button=ffffff
sidebar=000000
player=000000
main=000000
button-active=ffffff

6) There you go.
